# CSGO-Message-Helper
Fake your friends' messages in the CS:GO chat

The generated message that you can see right in the program is immediately copied to the clipboard. All you need to do is paste the copied into the CS: GO console. Due to the limitations of CS: GO, some marker colors differ from the original ones.
